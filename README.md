Click "Predict Crop Yield"
View results and recommendations

Via Python API:
pythonimport pickle
import numpy as np

# Load model and scaler
with open('agrilink_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

with open('agrilink_scaler.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)

# Prepare input features
features = np.array([[
    25,    # temperature_avg
    800,   # rainfall
    65,    # humidity
    6.5,   # soil_ph
    50,    # nitrogen_content

    2,     # pesticide_usage
    120,   # irrigation_days
    1      # crop_type_encoded
]])

# Scale and predict
features_scaled = scaler.transform(features)
prediction = model.predict(features_scaled)

print(f"Predicted Yield: {prediction[0]:.2f} tons/hectare")
